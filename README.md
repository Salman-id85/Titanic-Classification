# Titanic-Classification
Data Science

Project Overview
This project involves building a classification model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features. The Titanic dataset includes details such as passenger demographics, ticket information, and survival status. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies whether a passenger survived or not.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the Titanic dataset for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Building and training classification models to predict survival.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics to ensure accuracy and robustness.
# Workflow
Data Collection

Dataset: Load the Titanic dataset, which includes features such as Age, Sex, Pclass, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked.
# Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Address missing values in features like Age and Cabin.
Data Transformation: Convert categorical variables into numerical values (e.g., using one-hot encoding for Sex and Embarked).
Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize features if necessary.
Feature Engineering

Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features for the classification task.
Feature Creation: Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power (e.g., family size from SibSp and Parch).
# Model Training

Algorithm Selection: Experiment with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting.
Training: Train the selected models on the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to improve performance using techniques like grid search or random search.
# Model Evaluation

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to assess the model’s robustness and avoid overfitting.
